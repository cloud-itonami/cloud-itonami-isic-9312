# cloud-itonami-isic-9312

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC Rev.5 9312**: Activities of sports
clubs.

This repository publishes a sports-club-membership-governance actor --
member enrollment intake, per-jurisdiction membership-governance
regulatory assessment, disciplinary-complaint screening and
membership-action (suspension/expulsion) finalization -- as an OSS
business that any qualified, licensed operator can fork, deploy, run,
improve and sell, so a community or independent operator never
surrenders member/patron data and ledgers to a closed SaaS.

Built on this workspace's
[`langgraph`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/langgraph)
StateGraph runtime (portable `.cljc`, supervised superstep loop,
interrupts, Datomic/in-mem checkpoints) -- the same actor pattern as
every prior actor in this fleet

here it is **ClubOps-LLM ⊣ Membership Governor**.

> **Why an actor layer at all?** An LLM is great at drafting a member-
> intake summary, normalizing records, and checking whether a member's
> own recorded appeal window actually stays open past its own
> recorded minimum -- but it has **no notion of which jurisdiction's
> member-safeguarding/membership-governance law is official, no
> authority to finalize a real membership suspension or expulsion, and
> no way to know on its own whether a mandatory disciplinary complaint
> has actually stayed resolved**. Letting it finalize a membership
> action directly invites fabricated regulatory citations, a member
> being expelled before their own due-process appeal window has
> elapsed, and an unresolved disciplinary complaint being quietly
> overlooked -- and liability, and reputational risk, for whoever runs
> it. This project seals the ClubOps-LLM into a single node and wraps
> it with an independent **Membership Governor**, a human **approval
> workflow**, and an immutable **audit ledger**.

## Scope: what this actor does and does not do

This actor covers member enrollment intake through membership-
governance regulatory assessment, disciplinary-complaint screening
and membership-action finalization. It does **not**, by itself, hold
any license required to operate a sports club in a given jurisdiction,
and it does not claim to. It also does not adjudicate the underlying
conduct dispute itself -- `sportsclub.registry/appeal-window-still-
open?` is a pure ground-truth recompute against the member's own
recorded fields, not a disciplinary-hearing judgment. Whoever deploys
and operates a live instance (a licensed club operator) supplies any
jurisdiction-specific license, the real disciplinary-hearing process
and the real club-management-system integrations, and bears that
jurisdiction's liability -- the software supplies the governed, spec-
cited, audited execution scaffold so that operator does not have to
build the compliance layer from scratch.

### Actuation

**Finalizing a real membership suspension or expulsion is never
autonomous, at any phase, by construction.** Two independent layers
enforce this (`sportsclub.governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-
membership-action` high-stakes gate and `sportsclub.phase`'s phase
table, which never puts `:actuation/finalize-membership-action` in
any phase's `:auto` set) -- see `sportsclub.phase`'s docstring and
`test/sportsclub/phase_test.clj`'s
`finalize-membership-action-never-auto-at-any-phase`. The actor may
draft, check and recommend; a human club officer is always the one
who actually finalizes a membership action. Matching `leasing`'s/
`underwriting`'s/`testlab`'s/`clinic`'s/`veterinary`'s/`funeral`'s/
`parksafety`'s/`salon`'s/`entertainment`'s/`facility`'s/
`consulting`'s/`advertising`'s/`polling`'s/`research`'s/`design`'s/
`sports`'s/`alliedhealth`'s/`photo`'s/`personalservice`'s/
`edsupport`'s/`cultural`'s/`proserv`'s/`sportsevent`'s/
`recreation`'s single-actuation shape, grounded directly in this
blueprint's own README text ("No automated proposal, by itself, can
complete the following without governor approval and audit evidence:
finalizing a membership suspension or expulsion") -- both "suspension"
and "expulsion" are treated as ONE conceptual act (`:actuation/
finalize-membership-action`), a POSITIVE actuation (committing a real
membership-action record), matching this fleet's majority actuation
shape (`3600`/`6190` are the fleet's two NEGATIVE-actuation
exceptions).

## The core contract

```

**The ClubOps-LLM never finalizes a membership action the Membership
Governor would reject, and never does so without a human sign-off.**
Hard violations (fabricated regulatory requirements; unsupported
evidence; an unresolved disciplinary complaint; a still-open appeal
window; a double finalization) force **hold** and *cannot* be
approved past; a clean finalization proposal still always routes to a
human.

## Run

```bash
clojure -M:dev:run     # walk one clean single-actuation lifecycle + four HARD-hold cases through the actor
clojure -M:dev:test    # governor contract · phase invariants · store parity · registry conformance · facts coverage
clojure -M:lint        # clj-kondo (errors fail; CI mirrors this)
```

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot
performs the physical domain work**. Here a facility-access control
robot manages physical club-premises access, under the actor, gated
by the independent **Membership Governor**. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions require
human sign-off.

## Open business

This repository is not only source code. It is a public, forkable
business model:

| Layer | What is open |
|---|---|
| OSS core | Actor runtime, Membership Governor, membership-action draft records, audit ledger |
| Business blueprint | Customer, offer, pricing, unit economics, sales motion |
| Operator playbook | How to fork, license, deploy and support the service in a jurisdiction |
| Trust controls | Governance, security reporting, actuation invariant, audit requirements |

See [`docs/business-model.md`](docs/business-model.md) and
[`docs/operator-guide.md`](docs/operator-guide.md) to start this as an
open business on itonami.cloud, and
[`docs/adr/0001-architecture.md`](docs/adr/0001-architecture.md) for the
full architecture and decision record.

## Capability layer

This blueprint resolves its technology stack via
[`kotoba-lang/industry`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/industry) (ISIC
`9312`). This vertical's member/operational records are practice-
specific rather than a shared cross-operator data contract, so
`sportsclub.*` runs on the generic robotics/identity/forms/dmn/bpmn/
audit-ledger stack only -- no bespoke domain capability lib to
reference at all.

## Layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/sportsclub/store.cljc` | **Store** protocol -- `MemStore` ‖ `DatomicStore` (`langchain.db`) + append-only audit ledger + membership-action history. No dynamically-filed sub-record -- the actuation op acts directly on a pre-seeded member, and the double-actuation guard checks a dedicated `:membership-action-finalized?` boolean rather than a `:status` value |
| `src/sportsclub/registry.cljc` | Membership-action draft records, plus `appeal-window-still-open?` -- an HONEST reuse of this fleet's MINIMUM-threshold sufficiency family (the TENTH instance, reusing `personalservice`/9609's cooling-off-period SHAPE for a genuinely different real-world concept -- a due-process appeal window, not a consumer cooling-off right), not claimed as a new shape |
| `src/sportsclub/facts.cljc` | Per-jurisdiction member-safeguarding/membership-governance catalog with an official spec-basis citation per entry, honest coverage reporting |
| `src/sportsclub/clubopsllm.cljc` | **ClubOps-LLM** -- `mock-advisor` ‖ `llm-advisor`; intake/eligibility-verification/conduct-screening/membership-action proposals |
| `src/sportsclub/governor.cljc` | **Membership Governor** -- 5 HARD checks (spec-basis · evidence-incomplete · disciplinary-complaint-unresolved, unconditional evaluation, honest reuse of `association`/9412's concept, the 58th grounding of this discipline · appeal-window-still-open, MINIMUM-threshold reuse, the 10th instance, not claimed as new · already-finalized guard) + 1 soft (confidence/actuation gate) |
| `src/sportsclub/phase.cljc` | **Phase 0→3** -- read-only → assisted intake → assisted verify → supervised (membership-action finalization always human; member intake is the ONLY auto-eligible op, no direct capital risk) |
| `src/sportsclub/operation.cljc` | **OperationActor** -- langgraph-clj StateGraph |
| `src/sportsclub/sim.cljc` | demo driver |
| `test/sportsclub/*_test.clj` | governor contract · phase invariants · store parity · registry conformance · facts coverage |

## Business-process coverage (honest)

This actor covers member enrollment intake through membership-
governance regulatory assessment, disciplinary-complaint screening
and membership-action finalization -- the core governed lifecycle
this blueprint's own `docs/business-model.md` names as its Offer:

| Covered | Not covered (out of scope for this R0) |
|---|---|
| Member intake + per-jurisdiction evidence checklisting, HARD-gated on an official spec-basis citation (`:member/intake`/`:eligibility/verify`) | Real club-management-system integration, real disciplinary-hearing adjudication itself (see `sportsclub.facts`'s docstring) |
| Disciplinary-complaint screening, evaluated unconditionally so the screening op itself can HARD-hold on its own finding (`:conduct/screen`) | Schedule/competition-eligibility administration -- deliberately outside this actor's R0 scope (see this blueprint's own Offer text) |
| Membership-action (suspension/expulsion) finalization, HARD-gated on full evidence, a resolved disciplinary-complaint status and an elapsed appeal window, plus a double-finalization guard (`:actuation/finalize-membership-action`) | |
| Immutable audit ledger for every intake/verification/screening/finalization decision | |

Extending coverage is additive: add the next gate (e.g. a schedule/
competition-eligibility check) as its own governed op with its own
HARD checks and tests, following the SAME "an independent governor
re-verifies against the actor's own records before any real-world
act" pattern this repo's flagship op already establishes.

## Jurisdiction coverage (honest)

`sportsclub.facts/coverage` reports how many requested jurisdictions
actually have an official spec-basis in `sportsclub.facts/catalog` --
currently 4 seeded (JPN, USA, GBR, DEU) out of ~194 jurisdictions
worldwide. This is a starting catalog to prove the governor contract
end-to-end, not a claim of global coverage. Adding a jurisdiction is
additive: one map entry in `sportsclub.facts/catalog`, citing a real
official source -- never fabricate a jurisdiction's requirements to
make coverage look bigger.

## Maturity

`:implemented` -- `ClubOps-LLM` + `Membership Governor` run as real,
tested code (see `Run` above), promoted from the originally-published
`:blueprint`-tier scaffold, modeled closely on the seventy-two prior
actors' architecture. See `docs/adr/0001-architecture.md` for the
history and design.

## License

Code and implementation templates are AGPL-3.0-or-later.
